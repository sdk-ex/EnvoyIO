 ## Section 0: Table of Contents
  
 [ Note ]      
 This section is small for the time being, but it may expand later on. Right now our      
 most important goal is to get it up and running. Things like test and dev payloads       
 are first outlined in the `.note` files, and then added to the `.md` specifications.     
 That will change once the "`.note` graphical-compiler" is up and running, but for now     
 only the `README.md` file will contain all relevant docs.       

 
 Here is a brief table of contents for the project:
